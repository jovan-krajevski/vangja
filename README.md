A time-series forecasting package with an intuitive API capable of modeling short time series with prior knowledge derived from a similar long time series.

The package has been inspired by:

* [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html)
* [Facebook Prophet implementation in PyMC3](https://www.ritchievink.com/blog/2018/10/09/build-facebooks-prophet-in-pymc3-bayesian-time-series-analyis-with-generalized-additive-models/)
* [Timeseers](https://github.com/MBrouns/timeseers)
* [Modeling short time series with prior knowledge](https://minimizeregret.com/short-time-series-prior-knowledge)
* [Modeling short time series with prior knowledge - PyMC](https://juanitorduz.github.io/short_time_series_pymc/)
