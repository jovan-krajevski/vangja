    "# Chapter 06: Caveats of Hierarchical Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we saw how partial pooling allows related series to share seasonal information through a hierarchical structure, producing coherent predictions even in data gaps. In this chapter, we explore two important **caveats** of hierarchical modeling as implemented in vangja (following the [timeseers](https://github.com/MBrouns/timeseers) approach):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shrinkage strength is a hyperparameter** — The `shrinkage_strength` parameter controls how strongly individual series are pulled toward the shared mean. Different values produce different results, and there is no universal default. This parameter must be tuned for each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Opposite seasonality and the UniformConstant trick** — The timeseers library proposes using `UniformConstant(-1, 1)` as a multiplicative factor on seasonality to handle series with opposite seasonal patterns (e.g., summer vs winter products). We investigate whether this is necessary or whether partial pooling on the Fourier coefficients already handles opposite seasonality implicitly."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without UniformConstant**: The partial pooling model with high shrinkage on the Fourier coefficients ($\\text{shrinkage\\_strength} = 1000$) forces the shared seasonal mean $\\beta_{\\text{shared}}$ close to zero, because summer and winter products pull in opposite directions. The individual deviations $\\beta_{\\sigma}$ must compensate, but their prior is very tight. As a result, the model may produce weaker seasonal patterns, or the optimizer may find a solution where the seasonal signal is partly absorbed into the trend or noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With UniformConstant**: The constant $c_i$ absorbs the sign difference between groups. Summer products learn $c \\approx +1$, winter products learn $c \\approx -1$, and the all-year product learns $c \\approx 0$. This means $\\beta_{\\text{shared}}$ can represent the actual seasonal **shape** (magnitude and phase), and high shrinkage genuinely forces series to share the same seasonal shape — the intended behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The results reveal important insights about how partial pooling handles opposite seasonality. The `UniformConstant` trick is **not strictly necessary** — partial pooling can handle opposite seasonality by allowing individual deviations to have opposite signs. However, it becomes **increasingly valuable** as shrinkage strength increases:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Shrinkage | Without UC | With UC |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| Low (1-10) | Works fine — individual betas can freely deviate | Adds complexity with little benefit |\n",
    "| Moderate (10-100) | May weaken some seasonal patterns | Better separation of shape vs direction |\n",
    "| High (100-1000) | Shared mean ≈ 0, weak seasonality | Shared shape is meaningful, direction via constant |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UniformConstant` approach is most useful when:\n",
    "1. You have series with genuinely **opposite** seasonality (not just different amplitudes)\n",
    "2. You want **strong shrinkage** to share seasonal shape across series\n",
    "3. The seasonal **shape** is similar across groups but the **direction** differs\n",
    "\n",
    "If your series have simply **different** (not opposite) seasonal patterns, the `UniformConstant` adds unnecessary complexity and you are better off with lower shrinkage on the Fourier coefficients directly."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical modeling with partial pooling is a powerful technique, but it comes with important caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shrinkage strength is a hyperparameter**. There is no universal default. Too little shrinkage gives up the sharing benefit; too much forces series to be more similar than they truly are. Tune it via cross-validation or domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Opposite seasonality requires care**. When series have opposite seasonal patterns, the shared Fourier coefficients are pulled toward zero under high shrinkage. The `UniformConstant(-1, 1)` trick from timeseers elegantly separates *seasonal shape* from *seasonal direction*, enabling strong shrinkage on the shape while allowing the direction to vary per series. Without it, the model can still work with lower shrinkage, but the sharing benefit is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "These caveats are not weaknesses — they are inherent to any hierarchical model. Understanding them helps practitioners make informed modeling choices rather than blindly applying defaults."
